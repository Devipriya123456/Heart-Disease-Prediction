This python model performs data analysis and heart disease prediction using a dataset (`heart.csv`). It begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations to show the relationship between heart disease and factors like chest pain type, gender, age, and more. It then preprocesses the data using label encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical values. The data is split into training and test sets, and a Naive Bayes classifier is trained to predict heart disease presence. The model's accuracy is evaluated, and a test prediction is made using sample input. Overall, the script combines EDA and machine learning to understand and predict heart disease from patient data.
